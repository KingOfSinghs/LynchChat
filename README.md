# LynchChat
Hi Guys,

C# Client is for people who want to join your server and chat
C# Server is the server which controls and directs flow of messages

Your machine's IP Address is automatically updated via the first couple lines of code in the server
BUT Client has to PHYSICALLY ENTER THE SERVER MACHINE'S IP ADDRESS OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK

Please contact me with issues or fixes and enjoy,
Sincerely Jatin
